\details{
Data was extracted from \href{https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database}{Eurostat's database} in August 2020 through the directory: Database by themes -> Economy and finance -> Government statistics -> Government finance statistics -> Government deficit and debt -> Government deficit/surplus, debt and associated data. After sub-setting by country and selecting only data from 1999 to 2019, all the numbers from all the tables in this category were aggregated and then \code{\link[daubl]{smsdigit}} was used to obtain the second digits.
